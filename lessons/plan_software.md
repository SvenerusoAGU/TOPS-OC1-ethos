## Planning for Open Software

The data that supports your research results can only be fully understood when the software that generated or analyzed the data is documented and made open, or as open as possible. 
Additionally, Open Science considers your software to be its own research output and an important contribution to science. 

Software evolves during the research process and should be managed in accordance with your research teamâ€™s Open Science practices. 
At major milestones in the project, such as prior to publication, the version of your software used for your research is deposited in scientific repositories, documented with metadata, with its own author list (and theirORCIDs), licensed, and made as open as possible. 
Sound familiar?  It should.  These are the same steps for datasets, though the process is a bit different for software.

You can create and manage open software development on platforms like GitHub. 
These provide version control and change management and work well for team collaboration and also open collaboration. 
GitHub also has a built-in integration with Zenodo, a generalist scientific repository, that registered the selected software version and assigns a persistent identifier. For software, this is the publication method. 

You should plan to  include the citation of the software in the references of your paper so that when your paper is published, proper attribution can be given to the creators of the software as well as link the software to your paper. 
Include relevant information about your software in the paper, as well as a description in the availability statement using the recommended format of the journal.  

Any software you used that was created by others should also be cited in the references and described in the availability statement. 

The **Open Software** module has more information on sharing your software openly.
