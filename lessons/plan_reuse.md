## Planning for Reuse in Licensing

As a general rule, when you create something - a blog post, a published paper, a drawing, a dataset, software, or any other ‘creative’ work - you automatically own the copyright for that work yourself. 
This means that others **aren’t allowed to re-use it** without your permission, even if it’s freely available on the internet. 
As a researcher practicing Open Science, you can use a license to grant others permission to re-use your work, and even specify conditions on that reuse - perhaps you always want others to credit your work, or perhaps you don’t want your work to be used commercially. 

It is important to note that when you perform work for someone else, as an employee, contractor, volunteer, or a student, your contract may stipulate that the copyright for that work belongs to the institute you are working for. 
Before assigning a license to your work, check that you have the right to do so. 
Your institution’s intellectual property office and your funder may both have expectations around how you share your work and what license you use. 
A great (and possibly your best first) resource is your librarian.

Further, if an item does not include a license for reuse, it’s illegal to reuse it even if you can see the work online. 
Licenses are designed to take into account the legal ins-and-outs that each type of work can encounter.
