## Legal considerations that affect practicing Open Science

Similarly, certain countries, communities, and especially Indigenous peoples may historically have been exploited, and may wish to retain more rights over their knowledge to protect from further exploitation.
Globally, there are laws around the world that may cover some of these issues, but not all countries and regions have equal levels of protection, and some have none at all.
A set of principles, the CARE principles, provide guidance for data sovereignty.
These are discussed more in the Open Data module.

In some cases, it might not be legal to share all your research openly.
The amount that can be shared, and how, depends on the specific case.
If your research is affected by or related to these restrictions, be sure that you are aware of your requirements.
Check with your funder, or your employers’ grant office, librarian, or legal team.
Again, this is critically important in planning your research, before you prepare specific outputs.
  
- Work involving human subjects or on human data and samples, and other sensitive areas often requires initial external ethical review, e.g. in the US by an Institutional Review Board (IRB).

- If you are working on human health or with human health data, additional regulations apply, including on how patient or personally identifying data must be stored (HIPPA in the United States; GDPR in Europe, etc.)

- In the U.S., ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) regulations restrict sharing of defense information, data and materials including those related to spacecraft or satellite operations.
Similar laws apply in many other countries.

- In the U.S. and other countries certain laws restrict collaborations with citizens and/or government officials (variously defined) in countries where active sanctions or trade embargoes are in place.
Laws may restrict who you can include as collaborators or provide services to, but usually do not prevent general open sharing or open science.

- Patents are consistent with Open Science.
The usual requirement is simply that the patent application be filed before open communication of the results, e.g., through a presentation, preprint, or publication.
In the United States, and some other countries, institutions that receive grants usually retain ownership and responsibility for the data, software, and materials produced by the grant work.
They usually transfer the ability to steward these and sign licenses, especially for data, to researchers, but you should check with your institution, especially around materials, discoveries–including software–that might have intellectual property considerations.
Many are working to comply with new mandates on open data and software, and their preservation as well as for ensuring data privacy when needed.
