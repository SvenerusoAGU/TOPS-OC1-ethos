## Unethical Practitioners

Open science has led to several bad actors that have taken advantage of the system.
One of the most egregious are so-called “predatory publishers” that do not follow ethical practices in publishing while charging researchers for their publications.
These include both book and journal publishers.
Some also run “predatory conferences.”
These bad actors partake in a variety of concerning practices including falsifying peer review, publishing nonsense papers, employing fake editorial boards, creating fake persistent identifiers, and otherwise engaging in unethical publishing practices.
Beware of solicitations from journals or publishers you have not heard of.
Your librarian is a good resource for checking on a publisher or conference invitation if you have not heard of them.
