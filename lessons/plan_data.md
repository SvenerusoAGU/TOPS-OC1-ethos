## Planning for Open Data

As science is increasingly producing data and relying on it for new studies, enabling open data is one of the most important and valuable contributions. 
In Open Science, datasets that support your research are treated as their own valuable contributions to the scientific record, allowing their own author lists. 
They are created and managed during the research process in accordance with your research teamâ€™s Open Science practices.  
Throughout, or at major milestones, such as before publication, they are deposited in scientific repositories, documented with metadata and their own author list, (with their ORCIDs), licensed, and made as open as possible determined by the sensitivity of the data as defined by your country, community, and institution.  

Scientific repositories assign a persistent identifier when they register your dataset and make it openly accessible online.
This is also known as the publication method for datasets.
You enable the linking between your dataset and your soon-to-be published paper by including a citation to the dataset in the references of your paper.
You will no doubt include information about your data in the paper, as well as a description of your data in the availability statement using the recommended format of the journal.

Any data you used that was created by others should also be cited in the references and described in the availability statement. 

The **Open Data** module has more information on sharing your data openly.
