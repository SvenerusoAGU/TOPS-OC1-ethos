## Planning for Open Publication

As you finalize your research results you can seek feedback by publishing your draft manuscripts as a preprint before or simultaneously with submission to a peer-reviewed journal. 
Ensure that your datasets and software are submitted into an appropriate repository and ready for sharing prior to publishing your final paper. 

**Preprints:**  
A draft or submitted manuscript can be shared openly as a preprint, usually with no cost. Posting to a leading preprint server is best as they provide additional services to the Open Science ecosystem and are optimized for manuscripts. 
When your manuscript is published as a preprint this establishes or provides credit and a reference months before formal publication in a journal. 
Most preprint servers are field-specific; see a directory here: [https://asapbio.org/preprint-servers](https://asapbio.org/preprint-servers). 
Most post the manuscript online with a license, persistent identifier, and metadata within a few days of submission. More than 1200 journals now allow posting of preprints, and some transfer the submitted manuscripts directly if an author wants or allow transfer from the preprint server to a journal. 
Many preprint servers will link to the published version of the manuscript once it is available. Many funding agencies and publishers allow citations of preprints in grants or manuscripts.

Some preprint servers also accept conference presentations (e.g. posters and slide decks for presentations) and will soon accept educational resources. 
An example of a full service preprint server in the Earth, environmental, and space sciences is ESSOpenArchive.org, supported by a partnership of societies.  

**Peer-review Journals:**  
You likely give much thought into selecting the best journal for your research.  Here we focus on the options you have for making your research as open as possible. 
Most journals now allow open access publications, making papers free to read and with an open license, usually through  a publication fee. Many publishers now have agreements with some institutions that cover these for their researchers. 
Contact your institution, library,  or organization to identify which journals are supported for your author team. Most funders now also allow these publication fees to be included in grants.
In other cases, you can make papers open as a preprint or through an institutional repository. 
Ensure you cite your datasets and software in the Reference section and describe them along with any access information in the availability statement. 

Thus planning for open sharing and publishing includes identifying and discussing with your team the data and software repositories you might use, how these will be available for reviewers, and how you will provide for an accessible version of your paper when you publish.
