# Lesson 4: Planning for Open Science 

Any new activity requires a bit of planning to be sure you get the most out of it. 
Open Science practices do, too. 
They apply to your own research and any work done with a team.  
In fact, the more you help to bring along your teammates, the more you enable the benefits.

Perhaps the most important lesson from this entire course is to plan for Open Science from the inception, even designing the project with Open Science in mind. 
There are resources and tools that make this easy, and indeed doing so will improve efficiency and the value and impact of your work.  
The available resources are merely guides and practicing open science requires being intentional about bringing them into your context. 
The Open Resource Guide Activity is designed to help you in this process. 
This lesson provides a brief overview, including what you should be planning for, and we will dive in with more detail in the later modules covering **Open Data, Open Software, Open Results, and Open Tools and Resources**.  
Additional resources and knowledge may be available at your institution, including your department or library or among your colleagues practicing Open Science, and among the Open Science communities.

It is important to discuss Open Science with your research team, lab, group or partners at regular intervals in your research. 
Open Science may seem to be related to outputs–such as data, software, and publications–but preparing and organizing work for these in advance is critical. 
Doing so will save you time and hassle and prepare you for requirements at publication.

Planning for open science includes: speaking about it and organizing with your research team; deciding which tools to use;  thinking about authorship and credit; engaging with relevant research partners, for example, industry, around open science; identifying repositories for software and data; highlighting these approaches in your grant; and thinking about open results including publications. 
Ideally, a plan for open science should be included in your data management plan for your grant, including which repositories you plan to use.

A variety of tools are emerging to help manage Open Science practices, and to support international collaboration. 
These include tools such as the Open Science Framework hosted by the [Center for Open Science](https://www.cos.io/); GitHub, an online development platform for software; computational  notebooks, which help you organize and work with your text, software, and data together; online platforms for creating manuscripts, etc. 
More information about Open Science collaboration and management tools are in the Open Tools and Resources module. 
These platforms can be made open for your research team only, and then to the public when you are ready. 

In planning for Open Science when you preserve or publish your scientific results, data, and software you want to:

1.	 select publishing, software, and data platforms that enable the best metadata and linking through the ecosystem.
  - This supports discovery of your research results by others, ability for them to understand, ability to easily locate supporting or related results.
2.	provide access to your research results under as open a license as possible.
  - This supports use of your data and software by others, where you also will receive attribution.  This ensures equitable access to all with no cost. 
3.	be inclusive of all authors and contributors.
  - This supports research teams where all contributions are valuable and recognizes that those that contribute to only one or two of the research results can receive recognition for that work when the results are published separately. 
4.	ensure research results are connected through citation and use of persistent identifiers.
  - This supports proper attribution for each research result, accurate linking of related researcher results, and automated attribution  to enable attribution and linking.
