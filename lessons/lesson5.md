# Lesson 5: Addressing Complications in Open Science

Adopting Open Science practices requires intention and planning.
In these OpenCore modules, we are inviting you to start your initial steps and become an advocate for Open Science.
To be prepared, it is important to be aware of a range of complications and develop strategies for addressing them.

## Researcher’s Time and Effort

Two common concerns related to practicing Open Science as a researcher are that:
1.	It takes more time and effort. 
2.	Opening up my research will lead to others stealing my work or scooping it.

Yes, preparing and planning for Open Science can take more time as happens with any new approach. 
By better organizing, documenting, and making your research open you do your future self a huge favor when it comes time to document the full project and share your work with other future collaborators.
The material is already prepared and preserved and you don’t need to take the time for “every. single. person.” who finds your work compelling and requests  information.
You can point them to your ORCID profile, or your publication with all of the links to the data and software.  

The Open Science ecosystem is designed not just for open sharing but also to foster a culture for citation and recognition and valuing of data and software.
In the past, key contributors were not recognized, and only final manuscripts were part of the formal record; other outputs were not valued.
Using preprint servers for sharing manuscripts and presentations, and scientific repositories for data and software, allows this content to be indexed including for plagiarism checks.
Additionally, licenses can prescribe attribution through and citation.
Within the Open Science ecosystem, these practices provide accountability and transparency.
Open Science is consistent with and enables more and better credit and recognition, not less.
The sooner you publish ‘your’ content, the sooner it is part of the Open Science ecosystem and is discoverable and citable and thus contributing to the larger ethos.
