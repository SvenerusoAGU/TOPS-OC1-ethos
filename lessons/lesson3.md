Although the Open Science movement began decades ago, in part to provide free access to journal content and organize some key types of data, what is powerful today is that it is becoming optimized to support and indeed foster science and to support more engagement with society and use of science by society. 
This includes a number of active communities that are working to enable Open Science and help you, and the ability to make and enable new communities. 
Significant work and improvements are still needed, but the key pieces are in place such that all of the elements of Open Science become self-reinforcing. 
As a result, Open Science is the future of science.
