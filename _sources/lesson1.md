# Lesson 1: What Is Open Science and Why is it so Important?



Open Science organizes scientific collaboration and output around principles and values of accessible, reproducible, and inclusive science, leveraging the connectivity, speed, and services provided by the internet. 
It is a culture designed to promote and accelerate science and its social impact, and thus in turn public trust and support of science. 
It is also designed to help you and your research by making it more efficient and impactful overall. 
It reflects how science has evolved into the 21st Century, including the huge growth in data, instrumentation, computational power and resources, and complexity as well as its importance for addressing large societal challenges.  
Open science creates new opportunities for all, including researchers, funders, institutions, decision makers, public participants, and communities.

**Definition:** 
For the purposes of this course, Open Science is defined simply as: A collaborative culture enabled by technology that empowers the open sharing of data, information, and knowledge within the scientific community and the wider public to accelerate scientific research and understanding. 
The principles of open science are to make publicly funded scientific research transparent, inclusive, accessible, and reproducible. 
Open science requires a culture shift to a more inclusive, transparent, and collaborative scientific process, which will increase the pace and quality of scientific progress {cite:p}`ramachandran2021open `.

## Open Science - Nine Benefits

As you begin to adopt Open Science practices you will immediately benefit in your own research, your team, your discipline, international collaborations, and larger benefits to science and society.  
There are numerous examples now, and research, around how open science benefits society, science, and scientists. 
A recent example is from the Covid pandemic, where open and early sharing of data and results has been instrumental in many responses. 
A wide variety of open data supports global geodetic systems, enables weather predictions and climate models, and allows rapid responses to natural hazards.  
Open software is enabling new models and analysis of big data. All this builds public trust  

Here are some major benefits, framed as solutions around how they address key challenges:

**Impact:** Open Science increases the impact of your research.  

_Challenge_.  
Research that is not discoverable, understandable, and inclusive of a diverse team of collaborators  and the public is more likely to create barriers to access and provides a limited contribution to the scientific record that is difficult to evaluate and reproduce. 

_Open Science Solution_.   
The connectivity, services, and tools that make and enable Open Science increase awareness of your science, build and foster diverse global teams, improve data and software discovery, and improve efficiency.  They support public access and usage. These are highlighted in the other lessons and presented in the other modules.

**Data Collection and Analysis:**  Open Science enables data availability, quality, and reuse.

_Challenge_.  
Data across all scales of investigation in all disciplines has greatly exceeded  what can be conveyed and presented in journals. These data are increasingly valuable yet were often not openly available, or available at all. Some journals added supplements where data could be placed, with no standard approach, no quality control, and are not discoverable separately from the paper.

_Open Science Solution_.  
Placing scientific data in a repository that supports Open Science and metadata standards allows data to be discovered, connected and analyzed in new ways to solve important scientific questions and provide societal benefits. Additionally, it is easier for researchers  to reuse their own data when it is in standard formats and is documented with community-accepted metadata.
