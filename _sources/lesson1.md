# Lesson 1: What Is Open Science and Why is it so Important?



Open Science organizes scientific collaboration and output around principles and values of accessible, reproducible, and inclusive science, leveraging the connectivity, speed, and services provided by the internet. 
It is a culture designed to promote and accelerate science and its social impact, and thus in turn public trust and support of science. 
It is also designed to help you and your research by making it more efficient and impactful overall. 
It reflects how science has evolved into the 21st Century, including the huge growth in data, instrumentation, computational power and resources, and complexity as well as its importance for addressing large societal challenges.  
Open science creates new opportunities for all, including researchers, funders, institutions, decision makers, public participants, and communities.

**Definition:** 
For the purposes of this course, Open Science is defined simply as: A collaborative culture enabled by technology that empowers the open sharing of data, information, and knowledge within the scientific community and the wider public to accelerate scientific research and understanding. 
The principles of open science are to make publicly funded scientific research transparent, inclusive, accessible, and reproducible. 
Open science requires a culture shift to a more inclusive, transparent, and collaborative scientific process, which will increase the pace and quality of scientific progress {cite:p}`ramachandran2021open `.
