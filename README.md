# Ethos of Open Science

By the end of this module, learners will be familiar with the definitions central to open science and have explored some concrete examples of the benefits of open science principles and community. The course will include best practices for building open science communities, increasing collaboration, and introducing open principles to project design, as well as an overview of open science norms. This module will also explore the historical impact of “closed” science, and how open science seeks to create a more diverse and equitable scientific community.
